### GameFramework
The game Framework is a set of foundation components, scripts and classes that provide basic structure and functions to a game.
It is a core library aimed to help the dev of a game for its paticular needs in order to hide as much as possible the lower-level details of the game engine. It helps to solve tricky problems in game dev (entity movement, user/ai input, etc.) and reduce boilerplate code. for more info see the documentation.
